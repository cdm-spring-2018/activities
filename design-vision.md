# In-Class Writing Assignment: Envisioning Your Design 

The first "work in progress" assignment asks you to develop and implement an individual design concept for your Github Pages website which, by this time, should already be in progress. For this in-class writing assignment, I want you to do a focused freewrite (1-2 paragraphs, complete sentences) engaging with what kind of a design concept you might pursue. 

If you haven't yet made any design decisions, begin by describing what (in your opinion) makes a website (1) engaging, (2) aesthetically pleasing, (3) easy to use, and (4) impressive/memorable. What websites that you visit exemplify your sense of design? How might you combine different aspects of sites you like to form a unique "brand" for your own portoflio website?

Next, brainstorm some paths you might take in terms of your design concept. Design concepts often have a unifying idea or direction that guides decisions. This might be as simple as a keyword like "smooth" or as complex as "The simplicity of https://cardamomandtea.com meets the graphic sensibility and layout of https://nonagon.style".) 

If you have an initial thought already, put that on paper and try to develop it using the tips above.
