# Logo and Branding

According to almost any business resources, branding is "The process involved in creating a unique name and image for a product in the consumers' mind, mainly through advertising campaigns with a consistent theme. Branding aims to establish a significant and differentiated presence in the market that attracts and retains loyal customers." [source](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/branding.html) Logo design is just one aspect of how branding principles are applied in and outside of business. A logo is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public recognition. This I'm sure you know, as you have probably encountered countless logos. Logos are generally divided into three categories: standalone symbol, logotype/wordmark, and combination marks. Most branding concepts include all three. 

Using Photoshop, try making a combination mark logo for a now-defunct company. Imagine that this company is trying to make a comeback in the 21st century? What would their logo need to communicate? Who is the target audience/customer? Think about representation, association, size, color, typeface, alignment, and how the logo might be used with a new company slogan or other advertising elements. Upload your work to Box when finished.
