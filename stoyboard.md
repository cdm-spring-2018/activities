## Storyboard Activity 

Make a storyboard for a hypothetical short documentary-style film about one of the interpretive or design concepts we have studied this term. As Arola et. al. suggest, mockups and storyboards are crucial drafting strategies that can "help you create your road map to a great multimodal project" (93). A storyboard is specifically "a sequence of drawings, much like a comic book or visual outline, that represents the movement, spatial arrangements, and soundtracks of objects or characters in shots, screens, or scenes" (93). A storyboard is the typical place to map out your original ideas for communicating with your audience, and it expresses your overall plan for to plan for communicating your message in the most effective way. 

A documentary is simply a "film story concerning factual topics." Producing a documentary may seem straightforward, but documentary filmmakers mix various techniques to make their work as engaging, memorable, and persuasive as possible. Techniques like voiceover, background music, interviews, archival footage, and reenactment are all regularly employed in documentary film. Other media like static images, charts and graphs, and memorable statistics are mixed in. In this class, we won’t ever develop our storyboards into films. The upside of this constraint is that you can imagine your film any way you want. Cost and logistical challenges need not concern you. Instead, imagine an approach for bringing the idea we’ve learned about this semester to life in an engaging way, and illustrate a storyboard for that idea. 

Photoshop is the preferred software for this assignment. You may switch to any storyboard tool you like when/if you revise for the work in progress submission or the final portfolio.

4.	What are closure and the Law of Pragnanz, and how has understanding of these principles been used in design? (Lidwell)
5.	What are phantasms, and why do they matter in digital media? (Arola et. al.)
